# Reflection

Reading about Nadin Tamer’s Swift Playground showed me how one simple idea can grow into something meaningful when you care about the topic. I was inspired by how she turned science into an interactive experience instead of making a generic app. In the future, I would like to build a Swift project that helps people understand health and wellbeing through simple data visuals, dashboards, and playful interactions.

# Design: Smart Life – Health Tracker

My design is an iPhone SwiftUI-style screen for Smart Life, a minimal daily health dashboard.

The screen includes a large title, a one-line subtitle, and three clean rounded cards showing Steps, Water Intake, and Sleep.
