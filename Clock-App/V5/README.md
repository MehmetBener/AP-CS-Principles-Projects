• How did ForEach make your code simpler?

It let me repeat elements (numbers, colors, or emojis) without writing them one by one, which made my code a lot more modular and compact.


• What did you learn about randomness in programming?

Randomness adds variety and unpredictability, making the program feel less repetitive. It can be used pretty easily.


• Which part was most challenging: design, logic, or input/output?

The logic was hardest because I had to connect user input with updates on the clock, and i had to calculate the clock angles and stuff.

• How is this project similar to Scratch’s “repeat” and “pick random” blocks?

ForEach is like “repeat” since it repeats actions, and Swift’s random functions are like Scratch’s “pick random.”
