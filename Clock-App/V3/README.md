Spiderman Kids Clock
Target Audience

My target audience is kids who like Spiderman. The goal was to make a fun, colorful, and themed clock design that feels exciting for children while still teaching them how to read an analog clock.

Design Explanation

Main Character (Spiderman):
Spiderman is at the center of the clock, acting as the clock hands. His arms point to the time, making him the "hero" of telling time.

Villains at 3, 6, 9, 12:
The four iconic Spider-Man villains (Green Goblin, Venom, Kingpin, Doc Ock) sit at the cardinal points, making the clock both themed and engaging. Kids can anchor their reading of the clock using these familiar faces.

Color Theme:
Red, blue, and black dominate the palette to match Spider-Manâ€™s signature colors.

This design encourages kids to interact with the clock by recognizing characters and colors rather than just numbers.

Research (FigJam)

I collected and studied 3+ kid-friendly clock designs in FigJam:

Brightly colored animal clocks (to see how characters can help teach time).

Cartoon-themed clocks (to understand how licensed characters are integrated).

Minimal but playful shape-based clocks.


Reflection

Who is your target audience? Why?
My target audience is kids who like Spiderman. I wanted to make learning time exciting by combining superheroes with clocks.

How do your design choices support this audience?
Using Spiderman as the center and villains as the markers makes the clock fun, colorful, and relatable. Kids are more likely to stay engaged if their favorite hero is involved.

How did research (FigJam) influence your design?
I noticed how other kid clocks replaced numbers with characters or shapes. That inspired me to use villains and rectangles instead of plain numbers.

What was the most challenging part of coding?
Placing the elements in the precise and right location. I had to carefully adjust the rotation angles so the hands aligned correctly with the time.
